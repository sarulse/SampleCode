## Sample “CakePHP ” project 

### Summary of the project
	
*	An user inputs the data about a City in a HTML form and sends an email. 

*	There are three sections in the form: Location, Industries and Statistics. 

*	Either by clicking the section icon or title, the section drops down. 

*	If the user did not enter the information on required fields, error message will be displayed to re-enter the values on the 	    form. This is done through jquery and JavaScript. 

*	To send an email, user has to enter recipient's email address. 

*	Before emailing the form, message will be displayed showing the user inputs on the form. To edit any value, user has to re-enter the inputs.  

*	If message is not sent, sender will receive notification in his/her email address. 

*	Snap shots of the html form is attached for reference.
